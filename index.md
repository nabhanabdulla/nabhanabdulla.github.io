Myself Nabhan Abdulla, currently a junior year graduate student at NIT Calicut, India in Computer Science.
I was born and brought up in kerala, India.

I am interested in Machine learning and computer vision and is presently learning the fundamentals. I have been programming in Python for two years and freelance occassionally. I also have experience scripting with JavaScript, version control using Git and have basic knowledge of Ruby, PHP, HTML and CSS. 

I've always wanted to be productive and give back to the society. Currently I was introduced to [KWoC-2018](https://kwoc.kossiitkgp.org/) by a friend and *open source* contribution is turning out to be quite involving and fun. I am planning to *console.log()* my journey at [KWoC](https://kwoc.kossiitkgp.org/) through this blog for the time being. Stay tuned.
